# CabinAnalytics
Processwire module to show Cabin Analytics dashboard on an admin page.

This is a simple module that adds a page to your admin with an embedded public dashboard iframe from [Cabin Analytics](https://withcabin.com)

It has a single congfigurable field so far which is just the public dashboard id (ie the part after https://withcabin.com/public/ )

It doesn't render the front end script tag cos hey, it's only a single line - you can paste it in yourself.

The module was inspired by Craigs [WayFathomAnalytics](https://processwire.com/modules/way-fathom-analytics/) module .... but is a lot simpler.
